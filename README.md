In the frame of FreeCodeCamp I built this app. Check: https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-javascript-calculator

The application allows to do basic calculations. The actual calculation is done using Mathjs.evaluation.

Enjoy to try and calculate!

Cheers, Philipp
